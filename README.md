# The Multinomial Outcome Simulator (MOS) 
The MOS is an R and Shiny application for exploring multinomial models through 
simulation and visualization.

Specifically, users interact with an instance of the application by adjusting 
model inputs and then observing as the application simulates likelihoods for the 
model outcomes.

An MOS application instance is created by forking the MOS\_framework repo (or 
otherwise collecting the key files), customizing the MOS\_config.R file, and 
providing any resources needed by the instance (e.g., a data CSV, additional R 
scripts that process imported data, etc.).

This goal of this customization is to provide a specific multinomial model 
formula, the well-formatted data frame this model will be fit against, and 
some basic user-interface configuration.

Once an MOS application instance has been defined, it can be run and shared 
like any Shiny application (and there are a lot of options for 
[sharing a Shiny application](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson7/)).

A demonstration MOS instance hosted on AWS can be viewed 
[here](http://ec2-52-26-165-185.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3939/MOS_demo/). 
The complete code for the instance - along with a walkthrough of how to set up
an MOS instance - is 
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/bwaismeyer/MOS_demo).

## Application "Modes"
There are different application "modes", all built upon the same application 
infrastructure but with user interface features and visualizations tailored to 
different purposes. The application is currently designed so that users select 
between the modes via simple tab navigation.

As of this writing, the available modes are:
* Explore Mode: appropriate for observing how outcome likelihoods change across 
a range of values (e.g., How does the likelihood of winning a soccer match 
change as relative budget increases?)
* Single Case Mode: appropriate for simulating the likelihood of outcomes based 
on inputs for a specific case (e.g., What is the likelihood that a particular 
team will win a soccer match given certain team features?)
