## SCRIPT OVERVIEW

# GOAL: MOS_config.R is where a Multinomial Outcome Simulator (MOS) instance
#       is defined by an application administrator.
#
#       The MOS is a Shiny application that allows users to explore a given
#       multinomial logit model by interacting with simulations and 
#       visualizations based on that model.
#
#       The model formula and the data the model are fit against are provided to 
#       the application, which then builds the visualizations by:
#       (a) getting a model fit
#       (b) simulating outcomes from that model based on user inputs
#       (c) plotting the outcomes in the context of the user inputs
#
#       The MOS should (theoretically) take any multinomial logit formula
#       and its accompanying, properly formatted R data frame.
#
#       However, certain features of the MOS need to be specified for it
#       to work.
#
#       This config file is where those features are specified. It is sourced
#       by the MOS ui.R file when the application is initialized.
#
#       Non-functional example code has been provided in each configuration
#       section. A working example project with code can be observed here:
#       https://github.com/bwaismeyer/MOS_demo
#
#       You can see the example project in action here:
#       ## UPDATE NEEDED ##
#
# SCRIPT OUTLINE:
# - Name the Application Instance
#   - This is the title that will be displayed in the instance navigation and
#     should be a very concise description.
#
# - Import and Name the Data Object as Needed
#   - The multinomial logit model needs to be fit to a dataset. This dataset
#     needs to be be an R data frame named "base_data" (no quotes).
#   - This section is where the data frame is created (however that needs to 
#     be done) and assigned to "base_data".
#
# - Specify the Multinomial Logit Formula
#   - The multinomial logit formula needs to be provided explicitly and it
#     needs to appropriately reference the "base_data" data frame. The formula
#     needs to be assigned to "base_formula".
#
# - Variable Configuration
#   - We need to specify which variables will the user will be able to interact
#     with (via slider or facet). Key information must be provided for each
#     of these variables. See the section for details.
#
# - Custom Visualization Colors (Optional)
#   - Assign the custom colors (the same number as there are outcomes) to
#     the character string "custom_outcome_colors".
#   - If you don't want to use custom colors, set "custom_outcome_colors" to 
#     NULL.
#
# - Custom bootstrap.css (Optional)
#   - The bootstrap.css file should be placed in a subdirectory of the
#     application titled "www".
#   - Assign the name of the bootstrap.css file to the character string 
#     "custom_css" (just the name, Shiny will know to look in "www").
#   - If you don't want to use a custom bootstrap.css, set "custom_css" to NULL.
#
# - Ribbon Plot Addendum (Optional)
#   - If you want to provide any additional text (e.g., caveats, general
#     context) beneath the ribbon plot text body, you can assign an HTML-
#     formatted string to "ribbon_plot_addendum".
#   - Set this variable to NULL if you don't want to add anything.
#
# - Dot Cloud Plot Addendum (Optional)
#   - Same but for the dot cloud plot (dot_cloud_addendum).
#   - Set this variable to NULL if you don't want to add anything.
#
# - More Info Modal (Optional)
#   - If you want additional information about the plots to be available to
#     the user but you don't want to clutter up the space beneath the plot
#     with a lot of text...
#   - One option is to simply put HTML anchor tags and links into the relevant
#     addendum.
#   - However, if you don't want your user to have to leave the application,
#     you can adjust the features in this section to make a modal link and
#     window available to the user. The link will appear after the plot
#     addendum (if there is one).
#   - Modal details: http://ebailey78.github.io/shinyBS/docs/Modals.html
#   - Simply set "more_info_link_text" to NULL if you don't want to use the
#     modal at all.

#                               snap to whole numbers) (REQUIRED, defaults to
